# October 20th, 2022 - November 7th, 2022: I undertook this project as a method to predict stockprices in a quantitative way rather than the traditional way

This model should not be used for real life purposes as it is only a demonstration of ML.

For selecting a stock to predict, input "stock.symbol" from yahoo finance into the field (navigate to the line of code represented below). 

Given Below:

df = yf.download('input stocksymbol here', start='1998-03-08', end='2022-10-21')

Side note:
Doesn't work and have no clue what is going on, publishing is just for respecting the attempt. Plus I would never use this to make decsions, I'd rather prefer inversing Jim Cramer
